## Markov Chain

There is just status `transition` in the model. Using the previous status to obtain the probability distribution of the next status

## Hidden Markov Model(HMM) 
There are `evidence` for current and previous status, and use those evidence to obtain the probability distribution of `current hidden status`
therefore, for HMM, there are two sections:
1. Transition model 
2. Sensor model
